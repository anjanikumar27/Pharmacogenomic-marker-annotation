# Pharmacogenomic-marker-annotation
A Python script for annotating pharmacogenomic markers. The script merges a list of pgx_markers with genetic variant data from a .bim file, creating an annotated output file. Useful for researchers who need to cross-reference pharmacogenomic data with their own variant datasets.
